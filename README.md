Programming Language and Runtime
--------------------------------

This isn't really a thing,
it is just me experimenting
to see if I can create the basic
building blocks of a programming
language, write a basic lexer and
a parser and emit LLVM bytecode.

If it actually did evolve into a full language the goals might be something like this:
- Reactive programming as a first class concept and built into the language
- Strongly functional
- Stict depedency injection as part of the langauge
- Compiled rather than intepreted and no VM so it can run on iOS which disallows things like JITing.
